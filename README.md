# t3-chat-auto-theme-toggle
Tampermonkey script that automatically toggles T3 Chat theme based on system preference.

Install the script: https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/539511-t3-chat-auto-theme-toggle

Until Theo decides to implement auto theme switch in [t3.chat](https://t3.chat), here's a quick script that just auto-clicks the theme toggle button in the upper right corner depending on `prefers-color-scheme` in your browser.

Wanted it myself, thought I'd share :)
